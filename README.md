# CAPSTONE-1-PlayStore-app-review-analysis-Gaurav-Bisht
Here i've done a comprehensive analysis of google play store app consisting of data over more than 10k plus apps. This Analysis project was done by me individually. In this project i got 2 different CSV files as an input. The Csv files are Play Store Data.csv & User Review.csv.

This repository provides data analysis on a data set containing various apps data available on playstore. It answers questions like which category of apps are most installed?,how are the ratings and reviews? , what percentage of apps are free and what are paid?, Which age group accesses which category of apps etc. The project was made as a capstone project in Alma Better Madrid cohort
